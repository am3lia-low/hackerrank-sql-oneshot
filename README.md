# hackerrank-sql-solutions
MySQL solutions to some hackerrank problems i solved  
*insert wombat screaming*

if you solve these too, you can get SQL 3 stars in hackerrank (yay!!)  

i didn't include any explanations because my brain is kinda fried trying to transition from PostgreSQL  
and solve the problems at the same time  
if need be, Claude or Gemini will probably have a better explanation
